K-Means Clustering for Customer Segmentation

Overview

This project applies the K-Means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history. The goal is to identify customer segments and improve marketing strategies.

Implementation Steps

Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, standardize numerical features, and encode categorical features if necessary.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize customer spending behavior and patterns.

Feature Selection: Choose relevant features for clustering (e.g., total spend, frequency, recency).

Model Training: Train the K-Means clustering model and determine the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method.

Cluster Analysis: Interpret and analyze customer segments based on cluster assignments.

Business Insights: Use clustering results to tailor marketing strategies and customer engagement.
